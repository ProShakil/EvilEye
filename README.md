# EvilnoVNC
**EvilnoVNC** is a Ready to go Phishing Platform. 

Unlike other phishing techniques, EvilnoVNC allows 2FA bypassing by using a real browser over a noVNC connection.

In addition, this tool allows us to see in real time all of the victim's actions, access to their downloaded files and the entire browser profile, including cookies, saved passwords, browsing history and much more.
